            A sequel that features Riley entering puberty and experiencing brand new, more complex emotions as a result. As Riley tries to adapt to her teenage years, her old emotions try to adapt to the possibility of being replaced. Teenager Riley's mind headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who've long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren't sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she's not alone.
            When teenage Riley heads off to hockey camp, the puberty alarm in headquarters goes off and new emotions come in. When it turns out that these new emotions intend on completely changing Riley, Joy and the emotions are determined to stop them. As the years go by, new emotions begin to enter the headquarters of a young female who has traveled a far way. Along the way, the emotions that are already feel that they are getting kicked out of control and sight of the life of the young female who is growing up.

            My favorite character in inside out 2 is Joy because she's so positive about everything even when a lot of things goes wrong. Inside out 2 is a great movie because it's so interesting to watch and there isn't times in the movie where it wasn't interesting.
